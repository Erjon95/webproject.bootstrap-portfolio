# My First Portfolio
* **Objective** - To create a personalized portfolio detailing yourself.
* **Purpose** - To establish familiarity with bootstrap
* **Description**
    * You are provided with four different `html` template files in a `templates` directory at the root of this project.
    * Using the html tags that you already know, modify the html content so each individual file looks similar to their respective image.


## Part 1 - Clone the project
* Begin by _forking_ this project into a personal repository.
   * To do this, click the `Fork` button located at the top right of this page.
* Navigate to your github profile to find the _newly forked repository_.
* Clone the repository from **your account** into the `~/dev` directory.
* Open the newly cloned project in a code editor (Visual Studio Code, for example).
